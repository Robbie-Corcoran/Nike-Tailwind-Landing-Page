Welcome to my quick Nike Landing Page project, designed for educational purposes to showcase the integration of TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS for building a modern and responsive web page.

## Project Overview

This project replicates the design and functionality of a Nike landing page using TypeScript for enhanced type safety, React for dynamic UI components, and Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** Leverage TypeScript for static typing, improving code quality and developer productivity.
- **React Components:** Build reusable and interactive UI components using React for a dynamic user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilize the utility-first CSS framework to style components and create a visually appealing layout.
